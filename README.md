#Can game tweets for specific NFL games be used as a predictor for exciting games?

Living in Europe I can easily watch the early Sunday NFL games as they have kick-off times around 6 in the evening and finish up around 9. The problem is that the remaining games kick-off well past my bed-time. Thankfully, technology comes to the rescue and a subscription to NFL Gamepass means that I can watch the games after the fact, at a time that suits my schedule better. I always watch the Patriots game each week, but I can fit in one or two other games. I have always been frustrated by the fact that there are almost certainly one or two games that were extremely exciting, but I have no idea which ones they were without finding out the score; rendering watching them pointless. There are a number of websites that will rate how good a game was, but again, these always include spoilers. The NFL Network airs a show called NFL replay, that picks the best games of the week to show again, but even this is riddled with spoilers, so you donâ€™t get the full enjoyment of an exciting game without knowing the outcome.

Hence the question posed above. Can looking at data from tweets from each of the games give me an idea of which games were exciting to watch and which ones to avoid?
